# CSharpAdvancedJanuary2023


The "C# Advanced" module provides an opportunity to study the .NET platform and the C# language in various aspects. The focus is on building algorithmic thinking and learning the principles of object-oriented programming. The knowledge that the module provides includes working with linear data structures and their implementation in C#, working with streams, files and directories, creating template classes, software testing and software development design patterns. As a result of the acquired knowledge, at the end of the module, students will be able to build large projects, navigate them and test them, applying popular methodologies and good practices for writing code.
